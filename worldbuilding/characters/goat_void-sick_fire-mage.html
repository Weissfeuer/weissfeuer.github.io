        <h1>Goat void-sick Fire Mage</h1>
        
        <p>Race: Goat (find some more interesting name?)</p>
        <p>(move to separate page)</p>
        <p>> Race are guardians of volcanoes, inherently skilled in fire magic, keep balance and prevent eruption.</p>
        <p>> Understand importance of destruction and regrowth of nature.</p>
        <p>> Value restraint and training / self improvement , society made of different orders , value tradition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Void-sick: as per separate page, drains arcane energy from surroundings to sustain self, passively, stronger the more energy is missing , drain can be increased/decreased with focus.</p>
        <p>> This works against the social environment he lives in, snuffing out fires and disrupting balance.</p>
        <p>> (notorious with his people? barely tolerated , repeatedly tried to be re-integrated , outcast / trouble-maker , bad understanding of people?)</p>
        <p>> Can be used in tandem with fire magic:</p>
        <p>>> Void to fill arcane energies until full (passive energy loss), void attacks less powerful the more energy is consumed.</p>
        <p>>> Fire Magic to use up arcane energy, enabling (again) stronger void siphoning, potentially dangerous at low energy levels (physical damage to body if energy insufficient).</p>
        <p>Nickname with his people? -> snuffing out candles?</p>
