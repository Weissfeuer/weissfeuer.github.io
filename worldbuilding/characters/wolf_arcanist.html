        <h1>Wolf Arcanist</h1>
        
        <p>Race: Wolf (find more interesting name?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kind of a high society snob, not overly.</p>
        <p>Considers himself better than "impure" arcane casters, as he can cast pure arcane magic.</p>
        <p>Will still cooperate with others and his sense of superiority doesn't conflict with working with others.</p>
        <p>Can be insufferable.</p>
        <p>Highly competent with magic and has formal education.</p>
        <p>> Has a lot of knowledge of lesser known topics and most meta-magic techniques (siphoning, crystal creation, focus crystal use etc).</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a pure arcane caster can:</p>
        <p>  Cast any "impure" arcane magic, using formal instruction and learning.</p>
        <p>  Cast immensely destructive and unstable pure arcane magic.</p>
        <p>  Create and maintain portals to other domains (same location) either with high focus or with the help of someone versed in the respective domain.</p>
        <p>  > Unstable portals can be created to lead to other location, potentially dangerous and demanding a lot of focus.</p>
