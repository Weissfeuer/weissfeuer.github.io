        <h1>Opossum Illusionist</h1>
        
        <p>Race: Opossum (find more interesting name?)</p>
        <p>> Skittish, doesn't like being around people , natural Illusionists or other.</p>
        <p>> Race prefers own company, only ventures out to scavenge, afraid of other races.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Terrible self esteem , self worth , general anxiety , potentially physically unhealthy levels.</p>
        <p>Loner, away from own race, full time fake "mask".</p>
        <p>Uses illusion magic to disguise self , "wears a mental mask" has different, fake personality based on current illusion, changes outward confidence.</p>
        <p>Panic when illusion is broken or can be seen through.</p>
        <p>Takes a lot of time to warm up to people, needs to learn to be okay with people seeing them without illusions.</p>
        <p>> Only for friends, will keep up illusions for general public.</p>
        <p>Prefers overly confident mask, as a total swap of actual personality.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Illusions work on a per person basis, and has to be focused individually, more targets the less effective the illusion.</p>
        <p>> Avoids crowds.</p>
        <p>> Illusions cost less focus per individual person in a crowd, as they individually pay less attention to her, worse quality illusion is sufficient.</p>
        <p>Can see (domain sight) attention levels of people and can base illusion shape and quality based on that.</p>
        <p>Magic affects people's perception of reality and is both physical and arcane, drift to arcane (mind).</p>
        <p>Can be used to "white out" people, making their entire perception white and empty, effectively putting them into a coma.</p>
        <p>  As every illusion needs focus, demands constant magic.</p>
        <p>Illusions are not only visual but can be applied to any sense, at addition and focus cost.</p>
