        <h1>Magic</h1>
        <p>Magic underlies rules, just like physics do in real life.</p>
        <p>It is separated into spheres (or domains), not just as a scholarly distinction, but by being literally different dimensions coexisting.</p>
        <p>When talking about the dimension of a certain sphere, it may also be called a plane (of existence).</p>
        <br>
        <p>A typical person will have a body comprised of a physical, spirit and soul presence, while only being able to see physical with their eyes.</p>
        <p>While many races are born with a natural aptitude for casting magic of certain spheres, as long as a person has a presence or "body" in that sphere.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is to be noted that in general, magic from one sphere cannot directly interact with magic or objects in another sphere. On the other hand, most objects exist in many spheres, by different presences, in addition to the fact that the arcane sphere intersects with other spheres quite heavily. </p>
        <p>An example would be a fire spell, mostly comprised of arcane magic, still affecting wood, an object with no arcana presence. The magic in this case translates energy from the arcane into the physical, resulting in chaotic and often hard to control fire.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In order to cast magic, structure must be created in the desired sphere, with the desired form, to result in a magic effect. A more visual application is found in glyphing.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Primary spheres</h2>
        
        <p>Primary, or pure spheres, are actual sub-dimensions. They allow for bodies to exist within them and can spawn elementals, beings with a singular-sphere body.</p>
        <p>Casting magic of a pure sphere is usually more difficult and less intuitive, but allows for greater control, as you cast magic closer to their base rules.</p>
        <p>Primary spheres include the following:</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="./spheres/physical.html">Physical / Force</a></p>
        <p><a href="./spheres/spirit.html">Spirit</a></p>
        <p><a href="./spheres/soul.html">Soul</a></p>
        <p><a href="./spheres/arcane.html">Arcane</a></p>
        <p><a href="./spheres/divine.html">Divine</a></p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Secondary spheres</h2>
        
        <p>Secondary spheres are comprised of a mix of multiple primary spheres. They are do not have sub-dimensions and cannot create elementals.</p>
        <p>The common populous might call beings of multiple spheres "elementals" as long as none of those spheres include physical, due to a lack of magical understanding and the fact that they appear "invisible" to the naked eye.</p>
        <p>These spheres exist only as categories for the common folk and only vaguely describe their sphere-composition.</p>
