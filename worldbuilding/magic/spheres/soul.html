        <h1>Soul</h1>
        <img src="../../images/Icon_Soul.png" alt="Icon Soul">
        
        <p>The sphere of soul is said to harbor the essence of any being, that which lives on after death.</p>
        <p>This common misconception is one held by most people, even though they are not far off. Their concept of soul is reflected in the Spirit sphere instead.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The soul plane cannot hold any magical structure, it is impossible to cast any magic based on soul. The sphere is however popular with a special group of mages due to a different reason.</p>
        <p>Soul is only one thing: a massive potential for raw energy.</p>
        <p>In the trinity of body, spirit and soul, soul attaches furthest from the body and supplies both body and spirit with energy to last a lifetime.</p>
        <p>During a creature's lifespan it will consume it's own soul reserves to sustain itself, counter-acted by the spirit's power to draw in more ambient soul.</p>
        <p>However strong a creature's will and however efficient it might be, at some point the soul reservoir will be weak and the creature old. This is one of the reasons for aging and natural death.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Soul as a Resource</h2>
        
        <p>Anyone able to manipulate soul will find it an incredibly powerful and versatile resource to fuel any kind of magic, as soul energy can be transformed into any kind of other energy almost trivially.</p>
        <p>Soul is however not efficient to harvest, the ambient levels barely enough to crystallize.</p>
        <p>It is therefor best harvested from living creatures, particularly those with high reserves, such as sentient races.</p>
        <p>This fact is one of the two reasons for the foundation of necromancy, a practice banned and reviled by most races, due to what it does to it's victims.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Soul Sickness</h2>
        
        <p>Soul Sickness is the result of a living creature being stripped of their soul.</p>
        <p>While not technically necessary to survive, living without a soul is a truly terrible fate - and best avoided by a swift death.</p>
        <p>Without a soul, a creature's body will instead draw upon itself and it's spirit to sustain itself at all cost. Rapid aging, all loss of energy and dwindling perception of the world around them are the most common symptoms.</p>
        <p>Anyone unfortunate enough to have enough will to survive for a time will find their existence utter torture as all feeling turns to pain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Symptoms can be suppressed through a constant supply of soul, either through high enough ambient levels or through a second person supplying soul through magic, as affected beings cannot muster enough energy to cast magic to draw soul themselves.</p>
        <p>Soul sickness can only be cured by restoring a sufficient reservoir of soul to the sick. This however is only feasible through necromancy and you'll be hard pressed to find a necromancer willing to give up the resource they obtain by creating the soul sick in the first place.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Soul Sight</h2>
        
        <p>Soul sight is a discipline employed by and mostly reserved only to necromancers.</p>
        <p>Observed this way, the soul plane appears as a wide and endless nothing filled with white and milky clouds of soul. Living beings with souls will stand out as smaller, more condensed clouds.</p>
        <p>The most striking feature however, is the giant crystallized sphere of soul in the sky, correlating to the larger of the two moons.</p>
        <p>Staring directly into the moon like this however is a terrible idea. The sheer energy coming from it is enough to blind any necromancer within moments.</p>
        <p>Still necromancers prefer to build their lairs and housings with intentional openings to let the moon light in at any time, partially to better draw ambient soul and partially as tradition.</p>
