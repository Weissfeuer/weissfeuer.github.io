        <h1>Spirit Magic</h1>
        <img src="../../images/Icon_Spirit.png" alt="Icon Spirit">
        
        <p>Spirit magic is weird in it's representation in common and even academic knowledge.</p>
        <p>For the vast majority of people, spirit magic and it's sphere don't exist. Curiously enough most people attribute, mistakenly, to soul what spirit offers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the trinity of (physical) body, spirit and soul, spirit makes up what a person is, it's feelings and emotions, it's personality and all that is left after death.</p>
        <p>Spirit is closely interwoven with the physical body and draws upon soul as a source of energy. Possessing a spirit is what defines a being as alive and is a prerequisite for having a consciousness.</p>
        <p>A spirit closely resembles the shape of it's corresponding body, it's internal structure defining the person's personality and perception of things around it.</p>
        <p>A spirit without body quickly loses shape, depending on the willpower of the deceased, resulting in a true death.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Spirit Shamanism</h2>
        
        <p>Spirit magic is as unknown as the sphere itself, and even though every living being possesses a spirit, barely anyone may draw magic from it.</p>
        <p>Technically not mages, users of spirit magic are called shamans.</p>
        <p>The discipline cannot be learned unless one possesses the potential to do so. Beings born with spirit magic are never consciously aware of their potential and, at best, use it subconsciously before realizing their abilities later in life.</p>
        <p>Spirit shamans are incredibly rare and realizing their potential almost guaranties that they reach immortality and spirit-singularity at some point.</p>
        <p>A shaman's journey is long as they have to teach themselves by experience and experimentation, this is mostly to the fact that it is unlikely for another shaman to exist outside the spirit-singularity at the same time.</p>
        <p>Spirit magic draws it's strength primarily from the user's will, the manifestation of spirit itself.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Casting Spirit Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Spirit magic entails the full control and manipulation of all spirit matter.</p>
        <p>This includes manipulating other beings, altering their perception, to focus or to dull, or evoking emotions.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, since the spirit is so closely connected to the physical body of any being, it can be used to provoke reactions in said body.</p>
        <p>This can be used to somewhat easily, yet slowly, heal the body by making it heal itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Any sufficiently advanced shaman can also manipulate themselves, the basis to reach to singularity.</p>
        <p>They can transport and translate their physical body, entirely or in part, into the spirit plane. This can be used to avoid harm or facilitate travel.</p>
        <p>As a reminder, a body that "only" exists in the spirit plane cannot be harmed by physical or arcane means, unless the body still has a presence in those spheres.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Spirit Sight</h2>
        
        <p>In contrast to most other magic, shamans first learn to use spirit sight, before they learn to manipulate the sphere itself.</p>
        <p>Spirit sight allows the shaman to see all that is alive, and can be reasonable used to traverse the physical plane, given a natural environment.</p>
        <p>The spirit plane is usually defined by yellow-ish, green-ish colors, lush forests and far reaching plains lush with flowers and grass.</p>
        <p>The sphere is inhabited by many spirit elementals, feral as well as long dead beings, none of which are naturally aggressive. They will aid anyone in simple matters as they feel like it, before drifting off again.</p>
        <p>The most stunning sight is a giant, radiating spirit elemental in the sky, the spirit sun. It presents itself as a giant orb, with four tendrils wrapped around itself, appearing mostly inert.</p>
        <p>This being directly, and curiously, correlates to the bigger of the two moons, which is fixed in the sky, orbited by the smaller moon.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Spirit-Singularity</h2>
        
        <p>Being able to fully manipulate their own spirit allows shamans, even in the early stages of the singularity, to fully regenerate their physical body if it was destroyed, given sufficient time.</p>
        <p>As long as a shaman has enough force of will, they cannot be fully killed as long as not a greater force of spirit works against them.</p>
        <p>Reaching the singularity thus entails reaching a point at which having a sufficient amount of will is the natural state of the shaman.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Becoming immortal like this and having full control over all life's basis, the spirit, results in shamans no longer willing to mingle too much in mortal means. As coming this far also means reaching a certain amount of enlightenment and knowledge about oneself.</p>
        <p>Thus follows, that shamans who have reached the end of their journey only intervene when all of existence is endangered. Even then they only help as much as needed, allowing mortals the form their own path uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>This does not mean however, that a shaman will not offer small amounts of help, like a grandfatherly guide, to any who ask.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Death and Afterlife</h2>
        
        <p>After dying, a being's spirit separates from it's now destroyed physical body.</p>
        <p>Without a body to give it form, it loses shape quickly which can only be slowed by a persons will and unwillingness to die.</p>
        <p>Since a spirit's shape and structure corresponds directly to the beings perception and consciousness, the further a spirit deteriorates, the harder is will become to hold on.</p>
        <p>Any normal person, upon death, will be blinded and confused, barely able to keep it's spirit together. Unless a considerable amount of will is brought up, the being will dissipate within minutes, truly dying.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beings with enough will may manage to exist in an afterlife in the spirit plane for however long they can manage. People of renown or with striking personalities will sometimes by aided by natural spirit elementals, allowing them to live on.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bringing a person back from the death is technically possibly as long as the spirit still closely resembles it's structure in life.</p>
        <p>This obviously requires their previous body being restored to usable shape and the spirit being willing to re-attach to the body.</p>
        <p>These practices are however not practical. This is mostly due to the very limited understanding of there spirit sphere.</p>
        <p>Alternative methods exist however, based solely in healing magic. These require the spirit to be still attached to the body and have to be used within minutes after the "death".</p>
