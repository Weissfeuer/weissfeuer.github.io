        <h1>Arcane Magic</h1>
        <p>Arcane magic is the most versatile magic sphere, also called "the crossroads of magic".</p>
        <p>It easily mixes with other spheres and can manipulate any sphere to a moderate degree.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most races are born with an arcane presence in addition to the normal trifecta of physical,spirit and soul that their bodies are made from.</p>
        <p>The arcane presence usually takes on a form of tentacles, spreading from a person's back and coiling around their body. With those, the individual can manipulate the arcane and create structures, resulting in arcane spells.</p>
        <p>The form an arcane presence takes is somewhat malleable, reflecting what forms of magic the individual finds most intuitive or what they have trained most to cast.</p>
        <p>Individuals with an arcane presence are called mages, while colloquially any person able to cast magic is referred to as a mage, arcane or not.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As such, most people do not use arcane in it's pure form, instead using it to control the physical sphere from afar. This is colloquially called the elemental sphere, although it is usually referred to as one of it's specializations (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind, etc.).</p>
        <p>Wielding pure arcane magic is no small task and doesn't come naturally to practically any race. Pure arcana magic allows the mage to use raw arcane energies for spells ranging from chaotic destruction to finely structured portals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The sun is the biggest source of arcane energy, so much so, that it's sheer existence causes the giant ball of fire observable in the physical sphere. Just like with bare eyes, it is ill advised to look directly into the sun in the arcane plane.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Arcane Sight</h2>
        
        <p>Any arcane mage trained to use their arcane body to see can visually perceive the arcane sphere with varying effort.</p>
        <p>Observed this way, the arcane plane consists of a myriad of rivers and stars, primarily bathed in a purple-ish, pink-ish color.</p>
        <p>Wherever the arcane intersects with another sphere, colors of those respective spheres can be seen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Arcane sight is barely usable to navigate the physical plane as only other arcane mages and currently channeled arcane magic effects correlate to the physical sphere.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        
        <p>The existence of arcane magic is common knowledge, even though it's relation to elemental magic and what exactly it's pure form is is vague at best.</p>
