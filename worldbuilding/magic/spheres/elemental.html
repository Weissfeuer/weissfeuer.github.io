        <h1>Elemental Magic</h1>
        
        <p>All elemental magic exists on a spectrum between pure arcane magic and pure physical magic.</p>
        <p>An example with the more prominent forms of elemental magic would be, from arcane to physical:</p>
        <p>Fire - Air - Water - Earth</p>
        <br>
        <p>Not to misunderstand, elemental magic is no clear science and more of a wide range of different practices.</p>
        <p>Such is, that most practices are taught only by a select group of people or known by birth, given the simpler variations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Different practices of magic may show up on this page or a dedicated one if enough information on the topic warrants it.]</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Fire Magic</h2>
        
        <p>The most common type of learned magic, easy to pick up, hard to use. Fire is the magic of chaos and unpredictable energy.</p>
        <p>Fire magic can be invoked by simple projecting the chaotic nature of arcane energies onto the physical sphere. This requires barely any knowledge or structure and can be done by anyone willing to touch these volatile forces.</p>
        <p>From this results a certain stigma against fire-mages, as fire is easy to create and hard to control. In fact so much so, that many give up the practice after creating their first disaster.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyone willing enough and strict enough to control and master the art becomes a rare sight indeed. Revered by many, true masters of fire can control their conjurations completely, deciding what to harm and what to spare even amidst battle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Born fire mages are just as rare, fire being an element not commonly found in nature.</p>
                
        <br>
        <h2>Air Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Air magic controls all that is mist and vapor and everything that is easily moved. It is the magic of directed movement and action.</p>
        <p>Steering an arrow in flight, forming bubbles of stormy wind to protect, the air is as precise as it is far-reaching.</p>
        <p>Most races that fly by nature also intuitively know how to use air magic.</p>
            
        <br>
        <h2>Water Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Water magic can be used to assume control over anything fluid, be it viscous or barely mist.</p>
        <p>Races most commonly found close to large bodies of water are born with an affinity for water magic.</p>
        <p>They use it to breathe below the surface, disturb the water to fish or calm it for save travel.</p>
        <p>True masters know that water can be found everywhere and their power is limited only by their imagination as the what to do with it.</p>
             
        <br>
        <h2>Earth Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Earth magic is the most common magic to be born with, if you are a member of a land-dwelling race, chances are you can use at least a little bit of earth magic without issue.</p>
        <p>Conversely, it is also the hardest basic elemental magic to learn, for anyone without the proper intuition.</p>
        <p>Earth is slow and hard to move, changes made to it's form persist. It can terraform just as it can easily make improvised weapons. It can cause sandstorms and dry the land just as it can make it just as fertile.</p>
        <p>Using earth magic is all about understanding the pace of the land, it's limits and opportunities.</p>
                
        <br>
        <h2>Ice Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Ice Magic, in it's base is quite similar to water magic, yet so far removed, that it's practice is something entirely different.</p>
        <p>As fire is constant, unstoppable chaos and water is ever-flowing change, ice is silence. Ice is stillness.</p>
        <p>Ice constructs intricate, yet vast architecture. From small devices to entire cities.</p>
        <p>Not only become ice mages brilliant architects, they may calm and stop any motion, the cold is only a side effect.</p>
                
        <br>
        <h2>Nature Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Nature Magic is, and so will it's practitioners readily admit, not a singular type of magic. It borrows from other elements just as it does from nature itself. Nature magic is not about the elements, it's about how you use it.</p>
        <p>Nature mages never force their magic, they never act in pure anger. Nature mages follow nature and it's flow.</p>
        <p>Growing plants, directing streams, blossoming fires, nature mages take what is around them and amplify it, never creating on their own.</p>
                
        <br>
        <h2>Healing Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Healing Magic is about as sought after as it is feared. Healing magic is dangerous if wielded incorrectly.</p>
        <p>Just as you might try to mend, any mistake might be fatal.</p>
        <p>A practice offered to many, tested and tried only very few persevere. Healing magic is incredibly difficult, weaving not only in the arcane, but in the very body of your patient. Life, ever complex and ever unknowable, is no magic for those without iron focus.</p>
        <p>It combines many techniques of other school, to calm, to stop, to renew. Healers are naturally, due to their strict education, very versatile, and some of the most valuable people you will find in any situation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While nobody openly talks about it, any good healer also knows about the darker arts of necromancy.</p>
        <p>Working with living bodies, and healing them, requires knowledge of the soul and often many other practices to create fake life.</p>
        <p>No healer is proud of this fact, and many will even be feared by those that know about this.</p>
        <p>It doesn't help that many a necromancer pretends to be a healer to disguise their real intentions, and to get close to their unsuspecting victims.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nobody is born with healing magic. It is strictly taught.</p>
                
        <br>
        <h2>Light Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Light magic is an offshoot of fire magic. An attempt to bring order into the chaos.</p>
        <p>The result was highly unexpected and open the way for new kinds of constructs.</p>
        <p>Light is directed, ordered chaos, a beam of fire. With incredible precision and the bursting power of fire.</p>
        <p>It is not a battle craft, light needs to be meticulously controlled. On the other hand it allowed for energy to be easily transported over long distances or with high precision.</p>
        <p>What glyphing tried with ink and pen, burning often after a single use, Light could now make reusable with crystals and metal constructs.</p>
        <p>A device prepared with the teachings of glyphing and fueled by light could create any magic in an instant, as long as the light was channeled.</p>
        <p>While only moderately hard to learn, especially for master of the fire, the art is highly controlled by it's creators for it's limitless power.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../glyphs.html">glyphing</a> for more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In more simple terms, knowing even of the basic ideas of light (or some experimentation with fire) allows for the use of cold fire.</p>
        <p>This technique became popular with fire mages after they failed to replicate Light magic.</p>
        <p>Cold fire allows for harmless dispersion of visible light in many forms, it's most offensive capability in blinding a target.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Poison Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Strictly speaking, poison magic is a less common form of water magic. Moving around and safely applying toxins to weapons or even victims directly.</p>
        <p>The concept of poison magic stems from the fact that races which naturally produce poisons also usually employ water magic to manipulate what their body produces for them.</p>
        <p>More experienced mages may also use poison magic to more subtly alter a liquids make-up, resulting in more dangerous toxins from even harmless water.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Sound Magic</h2>
        
        <p>Famously first used by an avian bard to enhance his performance, sound magic has come a long way since it's inception.</p>
        <p>Sound bases magic varies from gentle tones to stimulate the very being of it's audience, to loud booming waves that can only be described as destructive.</p>
        <p>Not usually the first choice for self-defense, sound magic focuses on "silently" stimulating allies and manipulating enemies.</p>
        <p>Somewhat unknown, the element of surprise and subtle tactics make sound magic a thing to behold.</p>
