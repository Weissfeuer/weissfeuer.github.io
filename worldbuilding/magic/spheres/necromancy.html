        <h1>Necromancy</h1>
        
        <p>Necromancy is a cover term for the magical use of soul and the creation of arcane constructs.</p>
        <p>It is shunned in most societies for it's name-sake ability to "revive the dead".</p>
        <p>Necromancy is however much more than that and also more complicated than what a common person might know about it.</p>
