        <h1>Crystals</h1>
        
        <p>Crystals or Magic Crystals are crystallizations of magical energy.</p>
        <p>These can be consumed by any mage to gain the respective energy for their own use, whereby the crystal will be transformed back into energy and absorbed by the mage.</p>
        <p>Crystals come in many shapes, usually a generally vaguely round shape with tiny spikes extruding from it.</p>
        <p>Their shape does not change their function and can be changed by simple refinement processes (turning it into energy and re-crystallizing it).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Crystals will decay over time, based on the energies in their environment.</p>
        <p>Low energy environments accelerate decay and high energy environment can even cause the crystal to grow (naturally occurring crystals).</p>
        <p>To a small percentage, the crystal will always exchange energy with the environment and thereby become impure with the environment's energy. Specific storage procedures are recommended if this is to be avoided.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Crystals can contain any kind of magical energy as long as the energy can be crystallized (such as arcane, spirit, soul or even force).</p>
        <p>Usually crystals are not pure, as in they contain energy of multiple different spheres, this is normal as hardly any environment has purely one type of energy.</p>
        <p>Most people consider a crystal "pure" if it contains the same mixture of energies as their specific sub-domain (like fire magic being mostly arcane with some physical energy).</p>
        <p>However, crystals can be refined to have only one type of energy if it is necessary.</p>
        <p>Usually any mage will just not (be able to) absorb any unwanted kinds of energy the crystal might also contain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Crystals can be created by any mage able to cast whatever energy they want to crystallize.</p>
        <p>This process comes naturally to many races, mostly in inefficient forms and can be learned by everyone as long as they can cast magic.</p>
        <p>Crystals can be created directly from the environment, but many find it easier to use energy contained in their own bodies to create the crystal.</p>
        <p>Doing so will naturally drain the body of it's reserves, this is safe for everyone not suffering from void mutations.</p>
        <p>Many mages make use of crystallizing their own reserves to save them for later and allow their body to regenerate the energies on it's own.</p>
        <p>Correctly applied this can make a mage's energy output a lot more efficient.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Special care has to be taken when storing a lot of crystals in close proximity.</p>
        <p>Depending on the baseline stability of the energy, crystals might naturally try to fuse with each other or react and free their stored energy into the environment.</p>
