        <h1>Community Work</h1>
        
        <p>Everyone can add their own ideas and additions here.</p>
        <p>Best to name pages you add with "draft_name" possibly the authors name.</p>
        <p>Try to keep the place tidy.</p>
        <p>Pages that are finished and approved will be added to the main section.</p>
        <p>You can also just write down ideas and let me makes the full page later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you want to add / edit, request git access from me and get yourself git (or a git repository manager) and optionally an html editor.</p>
