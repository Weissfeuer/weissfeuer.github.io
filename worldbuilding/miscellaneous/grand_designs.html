        <h1>Grand Designs</h1>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>If by the design of an omnipotent god or mage, no-one knows exactly, how the grand designs came to be.</p>
        <p>While many don't even know about their existence, almost everyone is affected by them.</p>
        <p>Religious people will attribute them to their god, how they are as old as the world itself.</p>
        <p>Others will remember stories from a time, where some of the designs didn't exist.</p>
        <p>I can thereby be assumed, that they did not all come to be at the same time, maybe not even from the same source.</p>
        <p>Academics and doomsayers will talk about the catastrophe that would happen if any of them would cease to be.</p>
        <p>They say that the designs are all arcane in nature, grand as they are, but flawed all the same.</p>
        <p>Some exceptionally powerful or crafty mages may even nullify them temporarily in an area of their choosing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Academics are aware of a possible connection to divine magic, and the possibly disastrous implications that might have.</p>

        <h2>The common language</h2>
        <p>The grand design of the common language is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
        <p>Ever since coming into effect, all creature capable of language could speak it.</p>
        <p>From the highest aristocrat to the most secluded cave dweller, all could now communicate on common ground.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While this brought societies together and facilitated trade, it also brought a silent doom.</p>
        <p>Everyone could now communicate with everyone, and even children knew the language from birth, limited only by the concepts they could put into thought.</p>
        <p>But at the same time the older languages died.</p>
        <p>Since there was no use for them for many anymore, they were no longer being thought.</p>
        <p>If you did not keep them out of tradition, or as a manner to keep secrets, people forgot about them.</p>
        <p>This left many a ruin with ancient scripts, stories written in old languages, knowledge no-one thought anymore, forgotten.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The old, the wise, the educated now fear a time where the grand design of the common language will cease to be.</p>
        <p>A world with no language, a world with no communication.</p>
